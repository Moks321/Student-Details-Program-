# Student-Details-Program-
This is a student details program that I developed during my first year on Ulster University using Python.

The features of this program are:

  -Output a list of students and their respective details, including a summary report displaying the total number of students and breakdown of how many students are from each country
  - Output details of the youngest and oldest student(s) on the module
  - Option to add a new student and present a summary report displaying (a) the increase in total number of students and (b) the age difference in average age of students
  - Query if a student is on the course and output their details if found
  - Query the List to return students ordered in alphabetic order by Surname or numerically by youngest to oldest
  - Plot a labelled bar chart that presents the number of students from each country
